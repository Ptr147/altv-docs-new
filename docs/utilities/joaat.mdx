Jooat, short for "Jenkis one at a time", is a hashing algorithm utilized by GTA V to convert names into unique uint32 values.
A hash function takes an input, in this case, a name, and produces a fixed-size string of characters, which is the hash value.

A hash value is not case sensitive, meaning that the same name in different letter cases will result in the same hash value.
However, it is important to note that it is not possible to reverse the original name from its hashed value without using a brute-force method, which involves systematically trying all possible values until a match is found.

The Jooat hashing algorithm is a feature incorporated into the alt:V API for GTA V.
This feature allows developers to utilize the `alt.hash()` function directly on both the server and client sides.
By using this function, developers can effortlessly convert names into their corresponding hash values.
