# System requirements

Due to the utilization of additional technologies, alt:V has slightly higher minimum requirements compared to GTA V itself.
If your computer does not meet these requirements, you can still attempt to run alt:V; however, there is a significant likelihood of encountering issues or problems during gameplay.

:::info Custom servers

Please note that the minimum requirements provided are for a basic alt:V server.
However, depending on the installed mods and game scripts, higher system specifications may be necessary to avoid performance issues.
