If you have Kaspersky AntiVirus or Kaspersky Internet Security installed, you may encounter the "altv-client.dll can't be loaded" error, even if all necessary exceptions have been added.
The only known solution for this problem is to disable the virus scanner.
Additionally, keeping the alt:V window in focus can help minimize the likelihood of encountering this error.
It's worth noting that similar issues may arise with other antivirus software, such as Avast.
